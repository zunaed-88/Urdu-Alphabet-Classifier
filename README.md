# Urdu Alphabet Classifier

## Overview

This project is an Urdu Alphabet Classifier implemented using deep learning techniques. The classifier is trained to recognize and classify Urdu alphabet characters using a dataset of labeled images.

## Features

- **Alphabet Recognition:** The model is capable of recognizing and classifying Urdu alphabet characters.

- **Deep Learning:** Implemented using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.

- **Data Augmentation:** The model benefits from data augmentation techniques to enhance its ability to generalize.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the classifier consists of labeled images of Urdu alphabet characters. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure its suitability for training a deep learning model.

## Model Architecture

The classifier is built on a neural network architecture that includes layers for image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The model architecture is designed to effectively capture the patterns and features of Urdu alphabet characters.

## Training

The model was trained on a specified dataset using appropriate training parameters. The training process involved optimizing the model's weights and biases to achieve high accuracy in classifying Urdu alphabet characters.

## Usage

To use the classifier, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Load the trained model using the provided script.
3. Input an image containing a Urdu alphabet character for classification.

```bash
python classify_urdu_alphabet.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
